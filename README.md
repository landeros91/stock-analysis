# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Refactoring the code creates a better layout. Refactoring does take some time but the outcome is a better version for those who will view the data. The code is also better to read, than jumping from one macro to another. This would be considered "My conclusion", but in code, there is alwasy room for refinement.

##Results

### Pros
The benefit would be the run time gets cut down making the more efficient, with a clean cut of having everything in the same macro.

### Cons
It can take time to get this going. I had to revisit this multiple timess and get some assistance from coworkers to get better context. As a beginner, braking it down works for the sake of learning.
